# Hi Ky Duyen!

This is a place for you to do some simple projects for me.  

I will start really simple, then buoild up in complexity.  

Eventually, you will build a program that I have been thinking about.  You may even be able to market it!

As you progress, I will add more tasks.  I would like you to write the programs on your laptop, saving checkpoints. Then check them into github (Create an account if you don't have one).  Either share it with me (preferable) or make it public so I can see it so we can discuss and refine what you're doing.

1. Really simple - just write a "hello world" program.
1. Next, I would like you to use a loop to print the same "Hello World" message 10 times.
1. Next, I would like you to print a message asking for a user's name and then print "hello xxx" 5 times using the name they typed in.

I think that may be good for now.  Afrter each task is completed, please check it back into the repository.

HAVE FUN!
