# Hi Ky Duyen!

This is a place for you to do some simple projects for me.  

I will start really simple, then buoild up complexity.  

Eventually, you will build a program that I have been thinking about.  You may even be able to market it!

As you progress, I will add more tasks.

1. Really simple - just write a "hello world" program.
1. Next, I would like you to use a loop to print the same "Hello World" message 10 times.
1. Next, I would like you to print a message asking for a user's name and then print "hello xxx" 5 times using the name they typed in.

I think that may be good for now.  Afrter each task is completed, please check it back into the repository.

HAVE FUN!
